Linear Search



Linear Search is a simple search algorithm used in data structures. It involves checking each element of an array or list sequentially until the desired element is found or the end of the array is reached.

Features

Definition

Linear Search is a search algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the array until a match is found or the entire array is traversed.

Time Complexity

Worst Case: O(n) (you may need to traverse the entire array).

Space Complexity

O(1) (no additional space required).

Use Case

Best suited for:

Small datasets.

Unsorted arrays where other efficient algorithms (e.g., Binary Search) cannot be applied.

Implementation in C++
