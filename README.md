What is Linear Search?
Definition: A search algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the array until a match is found or the entire array is traversed.
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) in the worst case (because you might have to traverse the entire array).
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1), as it doesn't require extra space.
Use Case: Best for small datasets or when the array is unsorted.
